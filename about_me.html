                    <h3>Trust in the process</h3>
                <p>My theme towards life (and in return, my portfolio) is to trust in the process. The<br> same way that flowers somehow manage to bloom in the spring after the harshness of the <br>winter, 
                     and how the sun warms your body up after months of cold darkness. Life has a <br> wicked sense of humour; so sit back and enjoy the show sometimes: things will find their way. <br>
                  <br>
                  My point is: create a beautiful life. Embark on all its adventures. Create memories. <br>
                  Create a long-lasting effect, so that other people can, too, see flowers within the snow. <br>
                  <br>
                  Through my projects, I have seen first-hand what *creating* can do to the world.  Whether <br>it's solving healthcare challenges, fostering diversity in my work, or designing something <br> beautiful to make someone smile, I create to make a difference. <br>
                  <br>
                  People are both my inspiration and purposeâ€”my ode and my muse.<br>
